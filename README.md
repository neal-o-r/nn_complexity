# Neural Network Complexity

[This](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04615.pdf) paper proves some lower bounds on the kinds of concepts that can be efficiently learnt using neural nets, and it blew my mind. It surprised me in a way that I wasn't even fully convinced should have been surprising, so I wrote a bit of code to see if I could better understand what was going on. I can't say that it helped that much.
